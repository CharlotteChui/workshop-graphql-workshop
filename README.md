# README.md for Lab4
## What I Did
* I made a meme page for all the students of CS 52 to share their ideas
* On the front page, they can view all the memes that people have made
* With the Add New Post button they can add their own memes to the front page
* With The View Post Button they can see all the details of the meme and possibly edit the meme for the better.
### What Worked
* I thought that Redux was fairly easy to understand and connecting it to react was also pretty easy
* I enjoyed using Material UI as a basis for my UI. This was a very easy to make my UI look really nice. (Though it still took a long time)
### What Didn't Work
* I thought working with the API was very difficult and I ran into a bunch of small errors simply because I didn't know how the backend worked

## Grading Notes
* No extra credit was attempted
